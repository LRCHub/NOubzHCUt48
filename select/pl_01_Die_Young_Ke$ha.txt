I hear your heart beat
to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that
you came here with someone
So while you're here
in my arms
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
<♪>
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
Young hearts out our minds
Runnin like we outta time
Wild childs lookin good
Livin hard just like
we should
Dont care whose watching
when we tearing it up
(You Know)
That magic that
we got nobody can touch
(For sure)
Looking for some
trouble tonight
Take my hand
I'll show you the wild side
Like its the last night
of our lives
Well keep dancing till
we die
I hear your heart beat
to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that
you came here with someone
So while you're here
in my arms
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
<♪>
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
Young hunks taking shots
Stripping down to dirty socks
Music up gettin hot
Kiss me
give me all youve got
Its pretty obvious that
you've got a crush (you know)
That magic in your pants
its making me blush
(for sure)
Looking for some
trouble tonight
Take my hand
i'll show you the wild side
Like its the last night
of our lives
Well keep dancing till we die
<♪>
I hear your heart beat
to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that
you came here with someone
So while you're here
in my arms
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
I hear your heart beat
to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that
you came here with someone
So while you're here
in my arms
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Were gonna die young
Lets make the most
of the night
like were gonna die young
