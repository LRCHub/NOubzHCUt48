Whatever happens in the club, baby, stays there
I'm not gonna carry around my past
I'm just not waiting till that something's gonna happen
I'm gonna find it, baby, trust me, yeah

Live fast and die young
All we are looking for is hope and glory
'Cause I was born to run
There's not a boring page in my life story

Whatever happens in my life, baby, boost me
There's not a second that I'll regret
I'm just so full of life and ready to explore it
And it all feels like I'm ready to explode

I know that ever since that I was born
I was ready just to party on, yeah

Live fast and die young
All we are looking for is hope and glory
'Cause I was born to run
There's not a boring page in my life story

Go, go, we're not gonna live forever
Go, go, tonight is the night
Go, go, whatever happens, baby
Go, go, we are never gonna regret it

I'm a little schoolgirl in my daydreams
Lighting up the candles one by one
Freaky giant door men coming closer
Blowing out my candles, wake up now
Go, go, live fast
Go, go, die young
We're gonna live like there is no tomorrow
We're gonna live like there is no tomorrow

Live fast and die young
All we are looking for is hope and glory
'Cause I was born to run
There's not a boring page in my life story

Live fast, baby, and die young
There's not a minute I will waste on sorrows
'Cause I was born to run
I'm gonna live like there is no tomorrow
